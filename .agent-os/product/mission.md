# Product Mission

## Pitch

Laravel Model Versions is a comprehensive Laravel package that provides automatic model versioning capabilities for Eloquent models, helping Laravel developers implement audit trails and change tracking by providing complete version history, selective attribute versioning, and restore capabilities.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Enterprise Laravel Developers**: Development teams building business-critical applications requiring compliance and audit trails
- **SaaS Application Builders**: Developers creating multi-tenant applications needing comprehensive change tracking
- **Content Management System Developers**: Teams building CMS platforms requiring content version control and rollback capabilities

### User Personas

**Senior Laravel Developer** (28-45 years old)
- **Role:** Lead Developer / Tech Lead
- **Context:** Building enterprise applications with strict audit requirements
- **Pain Points:** Manual audit trail implementation, complex version tracking logic, compliance requirements
- **Goals:** Implement reliable change tracking, meet compliance standards, reduce development time

**Full-Stack Developer** (25-35 years old)
- **Role:** Software Engineer
- **Context:** Working on SaaS applications with collaborative editing features
- **Pain Points:** Data loss prevention, user change attribution, complex rollback mechanisms
- **Goals:** Provide seamless version control, enable collaborative features, ensure data integrity

## The Problem

### Manual Audit Trail Implementation

Laravel applications requiring audit trails typically need custom implementation for tracking model changes. This results in inconsistent implementations, increased development time, and potential compliance gaps.

**Our Solution:** Automatic versioning through a simple trait with zero configuration required.

### Complex Version Management

Existing solutions often lack comprehensive features like selective attribute versioning, user attribution, and restore capabilities. This leads to incomplete audit trails and limited functionality for enterprise needs.

**Our Solution:** Complete versioning ecosystem with selective versioning, user tracking, comments, and one-line restoration.

### Performance and Storage Concerns

Many audit solutions store every attribute change separately, leading to storage bloat and performance issues in high-traffic applications.

**Our Solution:** Efficient JSON storage with configurable attribute filtering and optimized database schema.

## Differentiators

### Zero-Configuration Automatic Versioning

Unlike manual audit trail implementations or complex versioning libraries, we provide automatic versioning with a single trait addition. This results in 90% faster implementation compared to custom solutions.

### Comprehensive Selective Versioning

Unlike basic audit packages that version everything or nothing, we provide granular control through versionableAttributes and nonVersionableAttributes arrays. This enables precise control over what gets versioned while maintaining performance.

### Enterprise-Ready Feature Set

Unlike simple change tracking solutions, we provide complete enterprise features including user attribution, version comments, temporary disabling, and one-line restoration. This results in production-ready audit capabilities without additional development.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **HasVersions Trait:** Single trait addition enables automatic versioning on model create/update operations
- **Automatic Version Creation:** Zero-configuration versioning with intelligent event handling
- **Selective Attribute Versioning:** Whitelist or blacklist specific attributes using versionableAttributes/nonVersionableAttributes
- **Version Restoration:** One-line model restoration to any previous version with restoreToVersion() method
- **Polymorphic Relationships:** Universal versioning support for any Eloquent model through polymorphic database design

### Collaboration Features

- **User Attribution:** Automatic tracking of authenticated users for each version creation
- **Version Comments:** Optional descriptive comments for contextual change tracking
- **Temporary Disabling:** Use withoutVersioning() callback or versioningDisabled property for bulk operations
- **Version History Access:** Complete version timeline with data, timestamps, and user information
- **Configurable Storage:** Customizable table names, user models, and auto-versioning toggles
