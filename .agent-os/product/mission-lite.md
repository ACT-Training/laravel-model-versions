# Product Mission (Lite)

Laravel Model Versions is a comprehensive Laravel package that provides automatic model versioning capabilities for Eloquent models, helping Laravel developers implement audit trails and change tracking by providing complete version history, selective attribute versioning, and restore capabilities.

Laravel Model Versions serves enterprise Laravel developers and SaaS application builders who need reliable audit trails and compliance features. Unlike manual audit implementations or basic change tracking solutions, Laravel Model Versions provides zero-configuration automatic versioning with enterprise features like user attribution, selective versioning, version comments, and one-line restoration capabilities.
